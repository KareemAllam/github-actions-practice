    name: "Mercury",
    description: "Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and the closest to the Sun. It has extreme temperature variations, from 427°C during the day to -173°C at night. Despite being closest to the Sun, it's not the hottest planet due to its lack of atmosphere.",

    name: "Venus",
    description: "Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system, even hotter than Mercury, due to its thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide. It's often called Earth's twin because of similar size, but it has a runaway greenhouse effect.",

    name: "Mars",
    description: "Mars is known as the Red Planet due to iron oxide on its surface. It has the largest volcano in the solar system (Olympus Mons) and evidence suggests it once had liquid water. It's a prime target for future human exploration.",

    name: "Jupiter",
    description: "Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, a gas giant with a Great Red Spot storm larger than Earth. It has over 80 moons and acts as a 'cosmic vacuum cleaner,' protecting inner planets from asteroids and comets.",

    name: "Saturn",
    description: "Saturn is famous for its prominent ring system made of ice and rock particles. It's a gas giant with a density so low it would float in water. It has 146 known moons, including Titan, which has a thick atmosphere.",

    name: "Uranus",
    description: "Uranus is unique because it rotates on its side, likely due to an ancient collision. It's an ice giant with a faint ring system and 27 known moons. It's the coldest planetary atmosphere in the solar system.",

    name: "Neptune",
    description: "Neptune is the windiest planet with speeds up to 2,100 km/h. It's an ice giant that takes 165 Earth years to orbit the Sun. It has a deep blue color due to methane in its atmosphere and 14 known moons.",

    name: "Sun",
    description: "The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star that makes up 99.86% of the solar system's mass. It's powered by nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium. It provides the energy that drives Earth's climate and weather.",
